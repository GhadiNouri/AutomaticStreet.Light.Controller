# Automatic Street Light Controller

Overview:
Simple hardware projects explaing the street-light system that work as a switch ON/OFF automatically. Built using electronics components only -No programming/microcontroller- and depened only on a light sensor to control the LEDs.

How it Works:
The work depened on the light sensor;
- When the sun rises: LED Sensor detuct the light of the sun -> LED turns OFF automaticlly.
- When the sun sets: LED Sensor detuct the darkness -> LED turns ON automaticlly.
  
Hardware Components: LED Sensor(LDR), Battery -9v-, Battery connector, Resistor -1k-, Transistor -2N222 NPN-, LED (WHIT), Wires

Build Method:
The project has been connected using the slodering, not a breadboar. The connection were created manually to simulate a real-world hardware implementation.

Features:
1-Fully automated ON/OFF control.
2-No programming required.
3-Simple, reliable electronics design.
4-Real hardware implementation.

Future Improvements:
1- Replace the LED with high-power light module.
2- Add Solar charging system.
3- Add motion detection for energy saving.
